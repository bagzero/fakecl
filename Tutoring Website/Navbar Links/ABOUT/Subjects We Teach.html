                        with the states of matter. <b style="color:white;">*It is recommended that unless the student specifically needs help in this field,
                        they learn Chemical Foundations first.*</b>

                    <h5 class="class-content">Stoichiometry & Nomenclature is a subject in Chemistry that connects to chemical
                        reactions. Stoichiometry deals with balancing chemical reaction equations, while Nomenclature looks at the
                        chemical names of different molecules. It also focuses on chemical formulas of different reactions.
