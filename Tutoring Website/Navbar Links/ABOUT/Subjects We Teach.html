                    <h5 class="class-content">Stoichiometry & Nomenclature is a subject in Chemistry that connects to chemical
                        reactions. Stoichiometry deals with balancing chemical reaction equations, while Nomenclature looks at the
                        chemical names of different molecules. It also focuses on chemical formulas of different reactions.
