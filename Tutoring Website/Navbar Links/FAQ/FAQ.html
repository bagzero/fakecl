                    regular nav-item having height of 100px, thus making dropdown-contents have a
                    gap due to the height of the nav-item so i made nav-dropdown-item to change height
                    to auto )

    Above, when writing multi-line typewriter text for "homepage-text" in other pages, you need to specify the second
    div's width of the exact amount of pixels, or second line will have width of 0 at start, meaning it will insert a line
    when typing, pushing everything below down.
        *note, this works for only if both lines don't fit in one line, if it does, you will have to rework some things.
